# crypto ðŸ’¸

Have a look at my new [Aavegotchi Baazaar explorer](http://aavegotchi.fyi) for a more full featured app.

A few little helper tools across the crypto world.

* [pools](https://share.streamlit.io/alexjj/crypto/pools.py) - Compares pancakeswap and pancakebunny for best CAKE staking
* [aavegotchi](http://gotchi.uk.to) - Gets latest market info and ranks gotchis and open portals by rarity per GHST

I have aspirations to add more items, integrate them more, and move beyond streamlit hosted pages.
However, [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) does make it really quick and easy to get a calc online.
